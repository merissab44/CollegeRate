# CollegeRate

Welcome to BlueMagix SPD Team Project! ðŸ‘‹ 

Our group project is a desktop website that connects college students to landlords in their area.

Our Problem: 

We find that with other sites like zillow and airbnb, itâ€™s not certain that these places give student 
discounts or if they even rent out to students. This can make the process really stressful as someone 
who is already stressed about paying for school.

Our Solution:

Our solution to this problem is to create a website that anyone can use but is specifically made to 
help college students find the right place for them. Every landlord who signs up for the website is 
agreeing that 1. They rent to students and 2. They offer student discounts. Sounds pretty cool right?

How was this built?

The front-end of the app was built using flask and bootstrap. Anything visible to the user was 
created with bootstrap and any in app handling was made with flask. We also deployed our beta version to heroku.

Whatâ€™s next for the site?

We want to develop this some more by moving it to mobile and change the ui to imitate almost a 
tinder like feed where students can view an image carousel and then swipe left or right on the place. 
Once they swipe right, it will prompt them to send a message or they can send one later. All of the 
places saved will pop up on their profile and they can click and message them directly from there as 
well. This ensures that emails arenâ€™t flooded with messages from places you arenâ€™t interested in anymore.
